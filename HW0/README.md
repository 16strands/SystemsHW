# Problem 1
a. I chose the number of iterations each time based on whether running that many objects with that many iterations 3 times would stabilize, down to 0.01us. 
  * For 2^8-2^11 I chose 10000 iterations 
  * For 2^12-2^13 I chose 1000
  * For 2^14-2^16 I chose 100
  * For 2^17-2^19 I chose 10
  * For 2^20-2^24 I chose 5
  
 b. Since I ran each of them three times to test stability, I selected the middle of the three numbers as my final answer.
