This is our implementation of the TCP server and client.

### TCP Server

Our server uses our implementation of the cache from HW2. We used code from boost.org (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_72_0/libs/beast/example/http/server/async/http_server_async.cpp to be exact) as a starting point for our project. We rewrote the code in handle_request so that requests access our cache data structure.
